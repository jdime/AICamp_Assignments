# AICamp_Assignments


Milestone project
================

In this project, we are going to practice how to implement supervised learning, dimensionality reduction and clustering models in Python. There are two datasets considered for this project including:<br />
1) Breast Cancer Dataset
 a) Available through sklearn (use load_breast_cancer as part of sklearn) <br />
 b) Link to the original dataset: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+(diagnostic) <br />
 c) Name: Wisconsin breast cancer dataset <br />
 d) Summary: Identifying if there is a malignant tumor or not using features that are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. <br />
 e) number of features: 30 (real, positive) <br />
 f) Number of data points (instances): 569 <br />
 g) dataset accessibility: Dataset is available as part of sklearn package <br />
2) Facebook metrics Dataset <br />
 a) Download the file form the link and read it in python using pandas <br />
 b) Link to the dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Facebook+Live+Sellers+in+Thailand <br />
 c) Name: Facebook Live Sellers in Thailand dataset <br />
 d) Summary: Posts of a different nature (video, photos, statuses, and links) on Facebook pages of 10 Thai fashion and cosmetics retail sellers <br />
 e) Number of features: 12 (we will work with 9 columns as features) <br />
 f) Number of data points (instances): 7051 (we will work with the first 1000 data points (rows)) <br />

Step 1:
================

You need to implement two important tasks in this step: <br />
1) Read the data files in each dataset and prepare them as dataframes. <br />
2) Implement three supervised machine learning methods on each dataset including <br />
 a) Regression <br />
 b) Random forest <br />
 c) k-NN <br />

Step 2:
================
You need to practice two important tasks in this step: <br />
1) Implement the following dimensionality reduction methods on each one of these datasets <br />
 a) PCA <br />
 b) t-SNE <br />
 c) UMAP <br />
2) Implement PCA and then implement three supervised machine learning methods on each dataset including <br />
 a) Regression <br />
 b) Random forest <br />
 c) k-NN <br />
 
Step 3:
================
You need to practice clustering in this step: <br />
1) Read the data files in each dataset and prepare them as data frames. <br />
2) Implement different clustering on each dataset including <br />
 <br />
Note. You can also practice proper visualization and working with different performance measures in each step. <br />
